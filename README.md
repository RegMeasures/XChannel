# XChannel
XChannel is a hydro-morphodynamic model of cross-channel evolution. The model simulates the evolution of river cross-section shape due to transverse bedload transport processes under the assumption of equilibrium longitudinal transport. Transverse sediment transport processes included in the model include:
- Transverse transport due to secondary currents (spiral flow) induced by a specified bend radius
- Transverse slope effects on bedload transport
- Bank erosion

XChannel is written in matlab but can be compiled to run without a matlab license (a license is still required for the compilation)
